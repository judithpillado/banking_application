# Banking Application
-----------------------------------

In this simple banking application, the user is able to check their balance, deposit, withdraw, and exit. You can check out how I did the project [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQbEH4tVMJA).

For this mini-project, you only need two things, a text editor and the JDK (Java Development Toolkit). Once you have the necessary tools, you can clone this repo and get started.
